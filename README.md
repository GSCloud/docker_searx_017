# searX 0.17.0 in Docker

[https://hub.docker.com/r/gscloudcz/searx]

## What is searX

SearX is a metasearch engine, inspired by the seeks project. It provides basic privacy by mixing your queries with searches on other platforms without storing search data. Queries are made using a POST request on every browser (except Chrome*). Therefore they show up in neither our logs, nor your url history. In case of Chrome* users there is an exception, SearX uses the search bar to perform GET requests. Searx can be added to your browser's search bar; moreover, it can be set as the default search engine.
